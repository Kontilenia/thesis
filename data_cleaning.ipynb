Number one is to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that are important to middle class Americans and those who are fighting to get into the middle class. So if you set aside budget fights for a second, we've been able to get now the Violence Against Women Act done. The conversations that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward. We've seen great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education. There have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence.\\nAnd what I'm going to keep on trying to do is to make sure that we push on those things that are important to families. And we won't get everything done all at once, but we can get a lot done. So that's point number one.\\nWith respect to the budget, what I've done is to make a case to the American people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy. And part of the challenge that we've had here is that not only Congress, but, I think, Washington generally spends all its time talking about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of time talking about how do we create jobs. So I want to make sure that we're talking about both.\\nI think that, for example, we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuilding our roads and bridges. And this is deferred maintenance. We know we're going to have to do it. And I went to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's State to John Boehner's State, and it was a rotten bridge, and everybody knows it. And I'll bet they really want to see that improved. Well, how do we do it? Let's have a conversation about it. That will create jobs. It will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety. That has to be part of this conversation, not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.\\nSo I guess my point is, Ari, that what I want to try to do is to make sure that we're constantly focused, that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed. Deficit reduction is part of that agenda and an important part. But it's not the only part. And I don't want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this one thing.\\nAnd as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that, over time\\u2014perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say, you know what, we stuck tough on the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the Republican Caucus is in a better mood when they come back\\u2014maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.\\nAnd the good thing about America is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we get stuck, and you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people pretty steadily are commonsense and practical, and eventually, that commonsense, practical approach wins out. And I think that's what will happen here as well.\\nAnd in the meantime, just to make the final point about the sequester, we will get through this. This is not going to be a apocalypse, I think, as some people have said. It's just dumb. And it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt individual people, and it's going to hurt the economy overall.\\nBut if Congress comes to its senses a week from now, a month from now, 3 months from now, then there's a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the American people dramatically. And so I\\u2014this is a temporary stop on what I believe is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness.\\nThank you very much. All right?\\n \",\n          \" Well, I would certainly consider that. I will mandate it if you'd like. I would\\u2014I think it's important to do, and I think, frankly, some of the Governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes. It was obvious right from the beginning. The State of Washington, where 26 or 28 people died very early on. And I would have said, \\\"nursing homes.\\\" And I did say \\\"nursing homes.\\\" That's what they should. Now, some of the States\\u2014many of the States are doing that, but I think all of the States should be. They have the capacity to do it. They should be doing nursing home.

When you see from\\u2014I think I can say, virtually, from the plane to whatever venue we were going to, it was wall-to-wall people.

Florida has been working on this for years. And they have a very good system of mail-in\\u2014and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify.\\nThey're so well run. Florida is a very well-run State: low taxes, low everything.

In maybe a couple of other States, they've worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn't take weeks or months.\\nIn the case of Nevada, they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks.

I was speaking out forcefully on what I think to be at stake. That's what it is.\\nAnd by the way, no one\\u2014no one\\u2014forgets who was on the side of King or\\u2014versus on\\u2014or Bull Connor. No one not\\u2014does not. The history books will note it. And what\\u2014I was making the case: \\\"Don't think this is a freebie. You don't get to vote this way, and then somehow it goes away. This will be\\u2014stick with you the rest of your career and long after you're gone.\\\" \",\n          \" True, we have not resolved all the problems relating to missile defense and the third site in Europe. However, I have already mentioned, before and today, we have seen once again that our U.S. partners not only understand our concerns but are sincerely trying to overcome our concerns. And another important observation is that I do have certain cautious optimism with regard to mutual agreements. I believe that this is possible. But the devil is in the details, and it is important here that our experts could work at the expert level. It is important for them to agree on the concrete confidence-building measures, and they should see how those measures will be implemented in practical terms.\\nAnd the third issue mentioned by President Bush\\u2014he said that we should work together on these systems. It would be desirable. I believe that this is the most important thing, if, at the expert level and then at the political level, we are able to start cooperation on a global missile defense system, as we are now talking about\\u2014[inaudible]\\u2014missile defense in Europe. If we manage to achieve this kind of level of cooperation on a global missile defense system, this will be the best kind of result for all our proceeding efforts. \\nPresident Bush. Precisely what he said is true. And that is, is that if we can, first of all, earn enough trust to be able to cooperate regionally and then globally, that's in our interest, because one of the concerns from the Russian side, a clear concern, is that if they believe the system is aimed at them, they're going to obviously do something about it. They'll spend money to avoid the system.\\nAnd I view this as defensive, not offense. And obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to convince the experts that the system is not aimed at Russia. It's really to help deal with the threats that we all are going to face. And therefore, the vision about having a global system is something I strongly support, where we're working cooperatively together. Look, there's a lot of\\u2014we got a lot of way to go.\\nAnd as to your question about the Czech Republic and Poland, it's important for the leaders in those countries\\u2014and I've discussed the issue with them\\u2014to understand that Russia is not an enemy; Russia is somebody with whom we need to work. And we'll work through the differences there as well. Transparency is going to require more than just a briefing. Transparency is going to require true openness in a system.\\nI have no problem with that. I have no problem sharing technologies and information to make sure that all people understand this system is designed to deal with multiple\\u2014I mean, single-or dual-launch regimes that could try to hold us hostage. This system is not designed to deal with Russia's capacity to launch multiple rockets.\\nNow, we got work to do, but we've come a long way since our first discussions. And this document really does express a vision that will make it better for America and Russia when\\u2014to work together along these lines. And so yes, I thank you for your question.\\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Missile Defense System/North Atlantic Treaty Organization \",\n          \" I'd like to see law enforcement take care of everything. I think everything should be taken care of\\u2014law enforcement.\\nBut again, we have to give our cops back, our police back their dignity, their respect. They're very talented people. They're strong. They're tough. They can do the job, but we've taken it away. We don't want to have\\u2014when somebody makes a mistake, he chokes, or\\u2014in some cases, you have bad cops, and we have to take care of that.\\nIn other cases, they choke. They're under\\u2014they have a quarter of a second\\u2014a quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes, they make the wrong decision. If they make the wrong decision\\u2014you know, if they make the wrong decision in the other direction, they're probably dead. So they choke sometimes, and that goes on the evening news for weeks.\\nAnd the thousands and tens of thousands of great things they do, nobody covers that. Nobody writes about that. But if they make a mistake\\u2014\\u2014\\nAnd again, the bad cops\\u2014everybody agrees they have to be very tough on bad cops. But sometimes you have a cop or a police person who is a good\\u2014a good police person, right? Good. But they choke. You know, the timing\\u2014and they go through this, and they study this, and they work on it all the time. They literally have a quarter of a second to make some of these decisions. And they make a wrong decision, and it's very devastating.\\nBut I will say this: I honor law enforcement. We wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for law enforcement. We have to stop this horrible, left-wing ideology that seems to be permeating our country. And basically, it's weakness. It's weakness on behalf of Democrat politicians.\\nThe Republicans, we don't have problems. You take a look at our cities; our cities are doing very well. They're safe. They're secure. I spent a lot of time in Texas, as you know, just a couple of days ago. And I was with the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott. He was explaining they wouldn't put up with it for a minute. They just don't have the kind of problems that other people have.\\nThank you very much.
