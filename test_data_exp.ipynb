But you were supportive of the holding off of any kind of cease-fire until Israel had a chance to clear out the Hizballah weapons. By all accounts, they did not exactly succeed in doing that. And by all accounts, the Lebanese Army, as it moved into southern Lebanon, had a-wink-and-a-nod arrangement with Hizballah not to disturb anything, to just leave things as they are, a situation not unknown in the Middle East. Do you demand that the peacekeeping force, if and when it gets up and running, disarm Hizballah?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Interview Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 199,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\nThe President. Speaking about books, somebody ought to add up the number of pages that have been written about my administration. There's a lot of books out there. A lot. I don't know if I've set the record or not, but I guess it means that I've made some hard decisions and will continue to make hard decisions.\\nAnd, David, this is the\\u2014this is about the fifth time I've been asked this type of question. And as you know, there are some things that I wish had happened differently: Abu Ghraib. I believe that really hurt us. It hurt us internationally. It kind of eased us off the moral high ground. In other words, we weren't a country that was capable of, on the one hand, promoting democracy, and then treating people decently. Now the world has seen that we've held those to account who are\\u2014who did this.\\nYou know, there's just a lot of look-backs. Presidents don't get to look back, but I will tell you, the decision to remove Saddam was the right decision. And I would look forward to the debate where people debate whether or not Saddam should still be in power.\\nAs you know, a leader in the Senate Intel Committee on, I think it was CBS News, Axelrod, I'm not sure\\u2014you follow your news closely; you can verify this\\u2014said that the world would be better if Saddam were in power. I strongly disagree. So when it comes to that decision, which is a decision to cause a lot of people to write books, it's the right decision.\\nAnd now the fundamental question is, will this country help this young democracy succeed? And the answer is, we will. We'll change tactics when we need to change tactics to help this young democracy succeed. But the stakes are high if we were to leave. It means that we would hand over a part of the region to extremists and radicals who would glorify a victory over the United States and use it to become\\u2014use it to recruit. It would give these people a chance to plot and plan and attack. It would give them resources from which to continue their efforts to spread their caliphate. The stakes are really high.\\nJoe [Joseph Curl, Washington Times].\\nImmigration Reform \",\n          \"\\nThe President. Steve, we're constantly changing tactics to achieve a strategic goal. Our strategic goal is a country which can defend itself, sustain itself, and govern itself. The strategic goal is to help this young democracy succeed in a world in which extremists are trying to intimidate rational people in order to topple moderate governments and to extend a caliphate.\\nThe stakes couldn't be any higher, as I said earlier, in the world in which we live. There are extreme elements that use religion to achieve objectives. And they want us to leave, and they want us to\\u2014and they want to topple government. They want to extend an ideological caliphate that is\\u2014has no concept of liberty inherent in their beliefs. They want to control oil resources, and they want to plot and plan and attack us again. That's their objectives. And so\\u2014 and our strategic objective is to prevent them from doing that. And we're constantly changing tactics to achieve that objective.\\nAnd I appreciate Senator Warner going over there and taking a look. I want you to notice, what he did say is, if the plan is now not working\\u2014the plan that's in place isn't working, America needs to adjust. I completely agree. That's what I talk to General Casey about. I said, General, the Baghdad security plan is in its early implementation. I support you strongly, but if you come into this office and say we need to do something differently, I support you. If you need more troops, I support you. If you're going to devise a new strategy, we're with you, because I trust General Casey to make the judgments necessary to put the tactics in place to help us achieve an objective.\\nAnd I appreciate Jimmy Baker\\u2014willingness to\\u2014he and Lee Hamilton are putting this\\u2014have got a group they put together that I think was Congressman Wolf's suggestion\\u2014or passing the law. We supported the idea. I think it's good to have some of our elder statesmen\\u2014I hate to call Baker an elder statesmen\\u2014but to go over there and take a look and to come back and make recommendations. Somebody said he said, \\\"Well, you know, cut-and-run isn't working.\\\" That's not our policy. Our policy is to help this country succeed, because I understand the stakes. And I'm going to repeat them one more time. As a matter of fact, I'm going to spend a lot of time repeating the stakes about what life is like in the Middle East.\\nIt is conceivable that there will be a world in which radical forms, extreme forms of religion fight each other for influence in the Middle East, in which they've got the capacity to use oil as an economic weapon. And when you throw in the mix a nuclear weapon in the hands of a sworn enemy of the United States, you begin to see an environment that would cause some later on in history to look back and say, \\\"How come they couldn't see the problem? What happened to them in the year 2006? Why weren't they able to see the problems now and deal with them before it came too late?\\\", Steve.\\nAnd so Iraq is an important part of dealing with this problem. And my vow to the American people is, I understand the stakes, and I understand what it would mean for us to leave before the job is done. And I look forward to listening how\\u2014what Jimmy Baker and Lee Hamilton say about how to get the job done. I appreciate them working on this issue because I think they understand what I know, and the stakes are high.\\nAnd the stakes are high when it comes to developing a Palestinian state so that Israel can live at peace. And the stakes are high when it comes to making sure the young democracy of Lebanon is able to fend off the extremists and radicals that want to crater that democracy.\\nThis is the real challenge of the 21st century. I like to tell people we're in an ideological struggle. And it's a struggle between extremists and radicals and people of moderation who want to simply live a peaceful life. And the calling of this country and in this century is whether or not we will help the forces of moderation prevail. That's the fundamental question facing the United States of America\\u2014beyond my Presidency. And you can tell I made my choice. And I made my choice because the most solemn duty of the American President and government is to protect this country from harm.\\nMartha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News]. Yes. I'm sure it was a profound followup. Okay.\\nSituation in North Korea/Six-Party Talks \",\n          \"\\nThe President. The truth of the matter is, if 1559, that's the United Nations Security Council resolution number, had been fully implemented, we wouldn't be in the situation we were in to begin with. There is\\u2014there will be another resolution coming out of the United Nations giving further instructions to the international force. First things first\\u2014is to get the rules of engagement clear so that the force will be robust, to help the Lebanese.\\nOne thing is for certain\\u2014is that when this force goes in to help Lebanon, Hizballah won't have that safe haven or that kind of freedom to run on the\\u2014in Lebanon's southern border. In other words, there's an opportunity to create a cushion, a security cushion. Hopefully, over time, Hizballah will disarm.
